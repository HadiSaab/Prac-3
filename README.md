Task 3.

1. Write a Python function shaker_sort(a_list) in a new file called shaker_sort.py, that implements shaker sort (see Tute 3 Exercise 5 for details).

2. Similar to Task 1 you need to provide at least two different test cases. test_shaker_sort.py has been provided for your convenience.

3. Write a function time_shaker_sort(a_list)

4. Write a Python function table_time_shaker_sort() that does the following:

    • For n = 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on up to 1,024
    
    • Creates a random list, a_list of reals between 0 and 1, whose length is n.
    
    • Prints on a newline n and the value of time_shaker_sort(a_list)

5. Cut and paste the output from the previous stage into Excel and make a graph. Explain the shape of the graph. Is it what you expected?

6. Write a Python function table_avg_time_shaker_sort() that does the following:

    • For n = 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on up to 1,024
    
    • Creates 100 random lists, of reals between 0 and 1, whose lengths are n.
    
    • Prints on a newline n and the average value of time_shaker_sort

7. Cut and paste the output from the previous stage into Excel and make a graph. Explain the shape of the graph. Is it what you expected?
